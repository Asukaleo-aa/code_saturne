  \section intro Introduction

  This page provides several examples of code blocks that may be used
  to initialize variables in \ref cs_user_initialization.

  These subroutines are called at beginning of the computation
  (restart or not) before the loop time step.

  These subroutines enable to initialize or modify (for restart)
  unkown variables and time step values.

  rom and viscl values are equal to ro0 and viscl0 or initialize
  by reading the restart file:
  - viscls and cp variables (when there are defined) have no value
  - excepted if they are read from a restart file.

  Physical quantities are defined in the following arrays:
   - propce (physical quantities defined at cell center),
   - propfb (physical quantities defined at border face center).

  Examples:
   - propce(iel, ipproc(irom  )) means rom  (iel)
   - propce(iel, ipproc(iviscl)) means viscl(iel)
   - propce(iel, ipproc(icp   )) means cp   (iel)
   - propce(iel, ipproc(ivisls(iscal))) means visls(iel, iscal)
   - propfb(ifac, ipprob(irom )) means romb  (ifac)

  Modification of the behaviour law of physical quantities (rom, viscl,
  viscls, cp) is not done here. It is the purpose of the user subroutine
  usphyv.

 Cells identification

  Cells may be identified using the 'getcel' subroutine.
  The syntax of this subroutine is described in the
  \ref cs_user_boundary_conditions subroutine,
  but a more thorough description can be found in the user guide.
