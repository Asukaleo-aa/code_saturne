General Information
===================

This directory contains the Code_Saturne CFD tool,
EDF's general purpose Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) software.

The basic capabilities of Code_Saturne enable the handling of either
incompressible or expandable flows with or without heat transfer and
turbulence. Dedicated modules are available for specific physics such as
radiative heat transfer, combustion (gas, coal, heavy fuel oil, ...),
magneto-hydrodynamics, compressible flows, two-phase flows
(Euler-Lagrange approach with two-way coupling), or atmospheric flows.

For more information, see the http://code-saturne.org website.

Presentation
============

Code_Saturne is portable on all Linux and UNIX platforms tested so far
(HP-UX, Solaris, Cray, IBM Blue Gene, Tru64, ...). It runs in parallel with
MPI on distributed memory machines (clusters, Cray XT, IBM Blue Gene, ...).
Developed since 1997 at EDF R&D, it is based on a co-located Finite Volume
approach that accepts meshes with any type of cell (tetrahedral, hexahedral,
prismatic, pyramidal, polyhedral...) and any type of grid structure
(unstructured, block structured, hybrid, conforming or with hanging nodes, ...).

Compatible mesh generators include I-Deas, GMSH, GAMBIT, Simail, SALOME,
Harpoon, ICEM, ... Post-processing output is available in EnSight, CGNS
and MED formats, with advanced data management capabilities by the FVM
library (EDF's "Finite Volume Mesh" library, under LGPL licence).
Parallel code coupling capabilities are also provided by the FVM library.

Code_Saturne can be coupled to EDF's thermal software SYRTHES (conjugate
heat transfer). It can also produce output usable by EDF's structural analysis
software Code_Aster, in particular in the SALOME platform. SYRTHES and
Code_Aster are developed by EDF and distributed under GNU GPL licence.
