* Particle tracking discards particles in case of warped faces
  ------------------------------------------------------------

The tracking algorithm assumes perfectly planar faces. A partial rewrite of
this algorithm, using new location tests, has been done for versions > 4.
The following patch provides this algorithm for version 4.0.
