Patches directory
=================

This directory contains files fixing potential problems that could arise
in some particular situations. These patches have not been fully validated
and therefore are NOT SUPPORTED.

* cs_perio.c: in some rare situations with periodicity, the halo definition
stage may fail, indicating a problem related to the preprocessor in case
of multiple periodicities. In fact, this may be due to a bug, not necessarily
related to preprocessing. In case this problem is encountered, the user can
test a replacement algorithm by copying this file in his study's FORT directory.
