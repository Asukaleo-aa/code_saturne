* Problem of consistency between two runs with different number of processors
  ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
Due to the way the code rescale the pressure at the outlet (in the standard
formulation), there can be some differences between two runs with different
number of processors. This is caused by the face number chosen by the code to
rescale the pressure profile.

patch: typecl.90
