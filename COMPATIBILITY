CODE_SATURNE VERSION 3.0
========================

This is version 3.0 of the Code_Saturne CFD tool.
It is composed of the following elements:
* Code_Saturne version 3.0 (including Graphical User Interface)
* Parallel Location and Exchange version 1.0
Other versions of these elements might not be compatible.


Compilers and interpreters
--------------------------
* C 99 and Fortran 95 compilers (and optionally a C++ compiler)
* Python 2.5 or above and Bourne shell interpreters


Optionnal libraries
-------------------
Here is given the list of optional libraries that can be linked to
Code_Saturne. Other versions (newer or older)
might still be compatible.
* pyqt: >= 4.3        - (necessary for the GUI)
* qt: >= 4.3          - (necessary for the GUI)
* libxml2: >= 2.6.19  - (necessary to read files built with the GUI)
* Metis: >= 5.0       - (for optimised domain decomposition)
* Par Metis: >= 4.0   - (for optimised domain decomposition)
* (PT-)Scotch >= 6    - (for optimised domain decomposition)
* CGNS: >= 3.1        - (to read or write CGNS files)
* MED:  >= 3.0        - (to read or write MED/SALOME files)
* hdf5: > 1.6.4       - (necessary for the MED and CGNS libraries)
* Zlib: 1.2.3         - (to import compressed meshes)


MPI libraries
-------------
In case of parallel computing, it is necessary to use a MPI library.
The following libraries have been used with success (latest version
number at the time of writing is given), but no specific command is
used in the code so any other MPI library should work.
* MPICH2: 1.2.5
* MPICH:  3.0.4
* Open-MPI: 1.6.4
