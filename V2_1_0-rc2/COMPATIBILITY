CODE_SATURNE VERSION 2.0
========================

This is version 2.0-rc2 of the Code_Saturne CFD tool.
It is composed of the following elements:
* Code_Saturne Kernel version 2.0-rc2 (including Graphical User Interface)
* Code_Saturne Preprocessor version 2.0-rc2
Other versions of these elements might not be compatible.


Compulsory libraries
--------------------
The BFT (Base Functions and Types) and FVM (Finite Volume Mesh) libraries
are compulsory. The MEI (Mathematical Expressions Interpreter) is optional.
They are distributed under the LGPL licence (copyright EDF S.A., France).
Code_Saturne version 2.0-rc2 is compliant with the following versions:
* BFT 1.1.3 or newer
* FVM 0.15.1 or newer
* MEI 1.0.2 or newer
Older versions might yet be compatible, possibly with limited features.


Optionnal libraries
-------------------
Here is given the list of optional libraries that can be linked to
Code_Saturne. The version number is the one used for developping and
testing version 2.0-beta2 of Code_Saturne. Other versions (newer or older)
might still be compatible.
* python: > 2.4     - (necessary for the Code_Saturne GUI)
          > 2.3     - (if Code_Saturne GUI is disabled)
* pyqt: > 4.3       - (necessary for the Code_Saturne GUI)
* qt: > 4.3         - (necessary for the Code_Saturne GUI)
* libxml2: > 2.6.19 - (necessary for the Code_Saturne GUI)
* swig: > 1.3.30    - (necessary for the MEI library)
* Metis: > 4.0      - (for optimised domain decomposition)
* CGNS: > 2.5
* MED_fichier:  > 2.3
* hdf5: > 1.6.4     - (necessary for MED_fichier library)
* Zlib: 1.2.3


MPI libraries
-------------
In case of parallel computing, it is necessary to use a MPI library.
The following libraries have been used with success (latest version
number at the time of writing is given), but no specific command is
used in the code so any other MPI library should work.
* LAM/MPI: 7.1.4
* MPICH: 1.2.7p1
* MPICH2: 1.2.1p1
* Open-MPI: 1.4.2
