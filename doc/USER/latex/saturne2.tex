\section{Key word list}
%==================================
%==================================
\label{prg_motscles}

The key words are classified under headings. For each key word of the Kernel of \CS,
the following data are given:

\noindent
\makebox[2.5cm][l]{Variable name}\makebox[1.3cm][l]{Type}%
\makebox[5cm][l]{Allowed values}%
\makebox[4.cm][l]{[Default]}O/C\hspace{1cm}Level\\
\hspace*{2.5cm}Description\\
\hspace*{2.5cm}Potential dependences


\begin{list}{$\bullet$}{}
\item \textbf{Variable name}: Name of the variable containing the key word.

\item \textbf{Type}: A (Array), I (Integer), R (Real number), C
      (Character string).

\item \textbf{Allowed values}: list or range of allowed values.

\item \textbf{Default}: value defined by the code before any user
      modification (every key word has one). In some cases, a
      non-allowed value is given (generally -999 or -1.D12), to force the
      user to specify a value. If he does not do it, the code may:
\begin{list}{-}{}
\item automatically use a recommended value (for instance, automatical
      choice of the variables for which chronological records will be
      generated).

\item stop, if the key word is essential (for instance, value of the
      time step).
\end{list}

\item \textbf{O/C}: Optional/Compulsory
\begin{list}{-}{}
\item O: optional key word, whose default value may be enough.

\item C: key word which must imperatively be specified (for instance,
      the time step).
\end{list}

\item \textbf{Level}: L1, L2 ou L3
\begin{list}{-}{}
\item L1 (level 1): the users will have to modify it in the framework of
      standard applications. The L1 key words are written in bold.

\item L2 (level 2): the users may have to modify it in the framework of
      advanced applications. The L2 key word are all optional.

\item L3 (level 3): the developers may have to modify it ; it keeps its
      default value in any other case. The L3 key word are all optional.
\end{list}

\item \textbf{Description}:  key word description, with its potential
      dependences.

\end{list}

The L1 key words can be modifed through the Graphical Use Interface or
in the \texttt{usini1} subroutine. L2 and L3 key words can only be modified through
the \texttt{usini1} subroutine, even if they do not appear in the version proposed
as example it the \texttt{FORT/USERS/base} directory.\\
It is however recommended not to modify the key words which do not belong to the L1
level.

The alphabetical key word list is displayed in the index, in the end of
this report.

\minititre{Notes}
$\bullet\ $The notation ``D'' refers to a double precision real. For
           instance, 1.8D-2 means 0.018. \\
$\bullet\ $The notation ``GRAND'' (which can be used in the code)
corresponds to 1.D12.

\minititre{Notes}
\begin{list}{$\bullet$}{}
\item Two different files can have neither the same unit number nor the
      same name.
\item  ASCII files (also called ``formatted'' files, in opposition to
      ``binary'' files) are bigger, longer to write and to read, but can
      be used on every architecture (in particular, it is an asset for
      calculation restart files). However, \CS can automatically recognise and
      convert Big Endian/Little Endian files. It is therefore usually possible on
      a given architecture to use binary restart files generated on another
      architecture.

\subsubsection{Post-processing for {\em EnSight} or other tools}
%==================================

\minititre{Notes}
$\bullet\quad$The format depends on the user choices.\\
$\bullet\quad$The post-processing files, directly generated by the Kernel
through the FVM library, can be of the following formats: {\em Ensight Gold},
{\em MED\_fichier} or {\em CGNS}. The use of the two latter formats depends on
the installation of the corresponding external libraries.\\
$\bullet\quad$For each quantity (problem unknow, preselected numerical
variable or preselected physical parameter), the user specifies if a
post-processing output is wanted. The output frequency can be set.\\


\motcle{ICHRVL}{I}{0 or 1}{1}{O}{L3}

 \motcle{ICHRSY}{I}{0 or 1}{0}{O}{L2}
 {indicates whether post-processing outputs are wanted (=1) or not (=0)
 on the 2D boundary mesh patches coupled with the \syrthes conjugate
 heat trabsfer code\\
 always useful}

 \motcle{ICHRMD}{I}{0, 1, 2, 10, 11 or 12}{0}{O}{L2}
 {indicates whether the post-processing geometry varies with time:\\
 \hspace*{1.3cm}= 0: time independent\\
 \hspace*{1.3cm}= 1: deforming or moving mesh\\
 \hspace*{1.3cm}= 2: changing vertex coordinates and topology\\
 \hspace*{1.3cm}= 10: time independent base, with time dependent nodal displacement field\\
 \hspace*{1.3cm}= 11: deforming or moving mesh, plus nodal displacement field\\

 \motcle{OPTCHR}{C}{string of less than 96 characters}{binary}{O}{L2}
 {options associated to the selected output format. The string is given as a
 series of key words, separated by a comma (and optional spaces). The key words
 are among the following:\\
 \hspace*{1.3cm}$\bullet\quad${\em text} for a text format (for {\em EnSight})\\
 \hspace*{1.3cm}$\bullet\quad${\em binary} for a binary format (default choice)\\
 \hspace*{1.3cm}$\bullet\quad${\em big\_endian} to force outputs to be in {\em big-endian}
 mode; this can be useful when using {\em ParaView}, which uses this mode by default.\\
 \hspace*{1.3cm}$\bullet\quad${\em discard\_polygons} to prevent from exporting faces with more
 than four edges (which may not be recognised by some post-processing tools); such
 faces will therefore appear as ``holes'' in the post-processing mesh.\\
 \hspace*{1.3cm}$\bullet\quad${\em discard\_polyhedra} to prevent from exporting elements which
 are neither tetrahedra, prisms, pyramids nor hexahedra (which may not be recognised by
 some post-processing tools); such elements will therefore appear as ``holes'' in
 the post-processing mesh\\
 \hspace*{1.3cm}$\bullet\quad${\em divide\_polygons} to divide faces with more than four edges
 into triangles, so that any post-processing tool can recognise them\\
 \hspace*{1.3cm}$\bullet\quad${\em divide\_polyhedra} to divide elements which are neither
 tetrahedra, prisms, pyramids nor hexahedra into simpler elements (tetrahedra and
 pyramids), so that any post-processing tool can recognise them\\
 \hspace*{1.3cm}$\bullet\quad${\em split\_tensors} to export the components of a tensor
 variable as a series of independent variables (always the case for now)}

With IPSTDV=1, none of these data are post-processed at the boundaries.\\

%==================================
\subsubsection{Chronological records of the variables on specific points}
%==================================

\minititre{Standard use through Interface or \texttt{usini1}}
For each quantity (problem unknown, preselected numerical variable or
preselected physical parameter), the user indicates whether chronological records
should be generated, the output period and the position of the
probes. The code produces chronological records at the cell centers located
closest to the geometric points defined by the user by means of their
coordinates. For each quantity, the number of probes and their
index-numbers must be specified (it is not mandatory to generate all
the variables at all the probes).


\motcleb{NCAPT}{I}{positive or null integer}{0}{O}{L1}
{total number of probes (limited to NCAPTM=100)\\
always useful }

\motcleb{XYZCAP}{RA}{real numbers}{0.D0}{O}{L1}

the coordinates are written: XYZCAP(I,J), with I = 1, 2 or 3 and J

{number IHISVR(N, 1) and index-numbers IHISVR(N, J$>$1) of the record
probes to be used for each variable, {\em i.e.} calculation variable
or physical property defined at the cell centers.
With IHISVR(N, 1)=-999 or -1, IHISVR(N, J$>$1) is useless.\\
\hspace*{.5cm} $\bullet$ IHISVR(N, 1): number of record probes to use
for the variable N\\
\hspace*{1.3cm}= -999: by default: chronogical records are generated on
all the probes if N is one of the main variables (pressure, velocity,
turbulence, scalars), the local time step or the turbulent
viscosity. For the other quantities, no chronological record is generated.\\
\hspace*{1.3cm}= -1: chronological records are produced on all the probes\\
\hspace*{1.3cm}= 0: no chronological record on any probe\\
\hspace*{1.3cm}$>0$: chronological record on IHISVR(N, 1) probes to be specified
with  IHISVR(N, J$>$1)\\
always useful, must be inferior or equal to NCAPT\\
\hspace*{.5cm} $\bullet$ IHISVR(N, J$>$1): index-numbers of the probes
used for the variable N\\
(with J$\leqslant$IHISVR(N,1)+1)\\
\hspace*{1.3cm}= -999: by default: if IHISVR(N, 1) $\ne$
-999, the  code stops. Otherwise, refer to the description of the case
IHISVR(N, 1)=-999\\
useful if and only if IHISVR(N, 1) $>$ 0 \\
The condition IHISVR(N, J) $\leqslant$NCAPT must be respected.\\
For an easier use, it is recommended to simply specify IHISVR(N,1)=-1 for
all the interesting variables.}

The default value is -1 if there is no chronological record file to
generate (if there is no probe, NCAPT = 0, or if IHISVR(N, 1)=0 for
all the variables) and 1 otherwise\\
If chronological records are generated, it is usually wise to keep the default
value NTHIST=1, in order to avoid missing any high frequency evolution (unless
the total number of time steps is much too big)\\
useful if and only if chronological record files are generated ({\em
i.e.} there are probes (NCAPT$>$0) there is N for which IHISVR(N, 1)

\hspace*{1.3cm}= -1: saving at the end of the calculation\\
\hspace*{1.3cm}$>$ 0: period (every NTHSAV time step)\\
During the calculation, the user can read the chronological record files
in the execution directory when they have been saved, {\em i.e.} at the first
time step, at the tenth time step and when the time step number is a multiple of
NTHSAV (multiple of (NTMABS-NTPABS)/4 if NTHSAV=0)\\
{\em Note: using the \texttt{ficstp} file allows to update the value of
NTMABS. Hence, if the calculation is at the time step n, the saving of the
chronological record files can be forced by changing NTMABS to NTPABS+4(n+1)
using \texttt{ficstp}; after the files have been saved, NTMABS can be put back
to its original value, still using \texttt{ficstp}.}\\
useful if and only if chronological record files are generated ({\em
i.e.} there are probes (NCAPT$>$0) there is N for which IHISVR(N, 1)

\subsubsection{Time averages}
%==================================

The code allows the calculation of time averages of the type
$<f_1*f_2...*f_n>$. The variables $f_i$ (defined at the cell centers)
which may be taken into account are the followings:
\begin{list}{-}{}
\item the solved calculation variables (velocity, pressure ...),
\item the auxiliary variables from the array PROPCE (density and
      physical properties when they are variable in space).
\end{list}

The averages are treated like auxiliary variables defined at the cell
centers and stored in the PROPCE array. The standard post-processing
actions may therefore be activated, like the writing in the listing or
the output of result files (EnSight, MED, ...). However, if the user
wants to manipulate the averages in a more advanced way, it is
recommended to refer first to the user subroutines \texttt{usproj} and
\texttt{usvpst} which provide examples. Indeed, the PROPCE array
does not contain the time averages directly, but only the cumulated value
of the product $f_1*f_2...*f_n$ of the selected
variables $f_i$. The division by the cumulated duration is done only
before the writing of the results. See also page \pageref{prg_moyennes}.

To calculate $p$ time averages of the type $<f_1*f_2...*f_{n(IMOM)}>$,
the user must:
\begin{list}{-}{}
\item make sure that $p\leqslant$NBMOMX (do not overstep the maximum
      number of averages),
\item make sure that $n(IMOM)\leqslant$NDGMOX for every average IMOM
       (do not overstep the maximum degree, {\it i.e} the maximum number
       of variables which may compose an average),
\item define every average IMOM (1$\leqslant$IMOM$\leqslant p$, without
      skipping any index-number) by marking out the $n(IMOM)$ variables
      which form it by means of the array IDFMOM(II,IMOM) (with
      1$\leqslant$II$\leqslant$n(IMOM)),
\item define for each average IMOM the time step number at which the
      calculation of the cumulated value must begin, by means of the
      array NTDMOM(IMOM).
\end{list}

The total number of averages ($p$=NBMOMT) is automatically determined by
the code from the values of IDTMOM. The user must not specify specify it.

The $k-\varepsilon$ (standard and linear production) and $R_{ij}-\varepsilon$
(LRR and SSG) turbulence
models implemented in \CS are ``High-Reynolds'' models. It is therefore
necessary to make sure that the thickness of the first cell neighboring
the wall is larger than the thickness of the viscous sublayer (at the
wall, $y^+>2.5$ is required as a minimum, and preferably between 30 and
100)\footnote{While creating the mesh, $y^+=\frac{yu*}{\nu}$ is
generally unknown. It can be roughly estimated as $\frac{yU}{10\nu}$, where
$U$ is the characteristic velocity, $\nu$ is the kinematic viscosity of the fluid
 and $y$ is the mid-height of the first cell near the wall.}. If the mesh does
 not respect this condition, the results may be biased
(particularly if thermal processes are involved). Using scalable wall-functions
(cf. key word IDEUCH) may help avoiding this problem.\\
The v2-f model is a ``Low-Reynolds'' model, it is therefore necessary to
make sure that the thickness of the first cell neighboring the wall is
smaller than the thickness of the viscous sublayer ($y^+<1$).\\
The $k-\omega$ SST model provides correct results whatever the thickness of the first cell.
Yet, it requires the knowledge of the distance to the wall in every
cell of the calculation domain. The user may refer to the key word
ICDPAR\index{ICDPAR} for more details about the potential limitations.\\
The $k-\varepsilon$ model with linear production allows to correct the
known flaw of the standard $k-\varepsilon$ model which overestimates the
turbulence level in case of strong velocity gradients (stopping point).\\
With LES, the wall functions are usually not greatly adapted. It is generally more advisable
(if possible) to refine the mesh towards the wall so that the first cell is in the
viscous sublayer, where the boundary conditions are simple natural no-slip conditions.\\
Concerning the LES model, the user may refer to the subroutine
\texttt{ussmag} for complements about the dynamic model. Its usage
and the interpretation of its results require particular attention.
In addition, the user must pay further attention when using the dynamic
model with the least squares method based on a partial extended
neighborhood (IMRGRA=3). Indeed, the results may be degraded if the user
does not implement his own way of averaging the dynamic constant in
\texttt{ussmag} (\textit{i.e.} if the user keeps the local average based
on the extended neighborhood).\\

%==================================
\subsubsection{Time scheme}
%==================================

By default, the standard time scheme is a first-order.
A second-order scheme is activated automatically with LES modeling.
On the other hand, when ``specific physics'' (gas combustion, pulverised coal,
compressible module) are activated, the second-order scheme is not allowed.

In the current version, the second-order time scheme is not compatible
with the estimators (IESCAL), the velocity-pressure coupling (IPUCOU),
the modeling of hydrostatic pressure (ICALHY and IPHYDR) and the time- or
space-variable time step (IDTVAR).

Also, in the case of a rotation periodicity, a proper second-order is not
ensured for the velocity, but calculations remain possible.

It is recommended to keep the default values of the variables listed
below. Hence, in standard cases, the user does not need to specify these
options.

\hspace*{1.3cm}IPOL is the degree of the Neumann polynomial used for the
preconditioning\footnote{$D$ being the diagonal part of $A$ and $X$ its
extra-diagonal part, it can be written
$A=D(Id+D^{-1}X)$. Therefore \mbox{$A^{-1}=(Id+D^{-1}X)^{-1}D^{-1}$}. A series
development of $Id+D^{-1}X$ can then be used which yields, symbolically,
\mbox{$Id+\sum\limits_{I=1}^{IPOL}\left(-D^{-1}X\right)^{I}$}.}.\\
IPOL is necessarily null with the Jacobi algorithm.\\
Concerning the computational time, the performance depends on the
case. If a preconditioning method different from
the diagonal preconditioning is to be used, it seems to be better to restrict
to a first-order preconditioning (IPOL=1). This preconditioning may save up to 10\%

When the density effects are important, the choice of
IPHYDR=1 allows to improve the interpolation of the pressure and correct the
non-physical velocities which may appear in highly
stratified areas or near horizontal walls (thus
avoiding the use of EXTRAG if the non-physical velocities are due only to
gravity effects).\\
The improved algorithm also allows to eradicate the velocity oscillations
which tend to appear at the frontiers of areas with high head losses.\\
In the case of a stratified flow, the calculation cost is higher when the
improved algorithm is used (about 30\% depending on the case) because
the hydrostatic pressure has to be recalculated at the outlet boundary
conditions: see ICALHY.\\
On meshes of insufficient quality, in order to
improve the convergence, it may be useful to increase the number of
iterations for the reconstruction of the pressure right-hand member,
{\em i.e.} \mbox{NSWRSM(IPR(IPHAS))}.\\

This option is automatically specified depending on the

ICALHY=0). The activation of this option generates an additional
calculation cost (about 30\% depending on the case).\\

%==================================
\subsubsection{Error estimators for Navier-Stokes}
%==================================

There are currently NESTMX\index{NESTMX}=4 types of local estimators
provided at every time step, with two possible definitions for
each\footnote{choice made by the user}. These scalars indicate the areas
(cells) in which some error types may be important. They are
stored in the array PROPCE containing the properties at the cells (see
IESTIM\index{IESTIM}). For each estimator, the code writes the minimum and
maximum values in the listing and generates post-processing outputs along with
the other variables.

The additional memory cost is about one real number per cell and per
estimator. The additional calculation cost is variable. For instance, on a
simple test case, the total estimator IESTOT generates an additional cost
of 15 to 20 $\%$ on the CPU time\footnote{indeed, all the first-order in
space differential terms have to be recalculated at the time $t^{\,n+1}$} ;
the cost of the three others may be neglected. If the user wants to
avoid the calculation of the estimators during the computation, it is
possible to run a calculation without estimators first, and then activate them on
a restart of one or two time steps.

It is recommended to use the estimators only for visual and qualitative
analysis. Also, their use is compatible neither with a second-order time scheme
nor with a calculation with a frozen velocity field.

{\bf IEST = IESPRE\index{IESPRE}: prediction} (default name: EsPre).
After the velocity prediction step (yielding $\vect{u}^*$), the
estimator $\eta^{\,pred}_{\,i,k}(\vect{u}^*)$, local variable calculated
at every cell $\Omega_i$, is created from $\vect{\mathcal
R}^{\,pred}(\vect{u}^*)$, which represents the residual of the equation
solved during this step:
\begin{eqnarray*}
\vect{\mathcal R}^{\,pred}(\vect{u}^*)&= & \rho^n \frac{\vect{u}^*-\vect{u}^n}{\Delta t}
              + \rho^n \vect{u}^n \cdot \tens{grad}(\vect{u}^*)
              - div \left((\mu+\mu_t)^n \tens{grad}(\vect{u}^*) \right)
              + \grad(P^n)     \\
              &- &\text{rest of the right-hand member}
                        \,(\vect{u}^n, P^n, \text{other variables}^n)
\end{eqnarray*}
By definition:
$$ \eta^{\,pred}_{\,i,k}(\vect{u}^*)= {|\Omega_i|}^{\,(k-2)/2}\ ||\vect{\mathcal R}^{\,pred}(\vect{u}^*)||
_{{I\hspace{-.25em}L}^{2}(\Omega_i)}$$
\hspace*{0.5cm}$\bullet$ The first family, $k=1$, suppresses the
volume $|\Omega_i|$ which intrinsicly appears  with the norm
${{I\hspace{-.25em}L}^{2}(\Omega_i)}$.\\
\hspace*{0.5cm}$\bullet$ The second family, $k=2$, exactly represents the norm
${{I\hspace{-.25em}L}^{2}(\Omega_i)}$. The size of the cell therefore
appears in its calculation and induces a weighting effect.\\
$ \eta^{\,pred}_{\,i,k}(\vect{u}^*)$  is ideally equal to zero when the
reconstruction methods are perfect and the associated system is
solved exactly.

{\bf IEST = IESDER\index{IESDER}: drift}  (default name: EsDer).
The estimator $\eta^{\,der}_{\,i,k}(\vect{u}^{\,n+1})$ is based on the
following quantity (intrinsic to the code):
\begin{equation}
\begin{array}{lll}
 \eta^{\,der}_{\,i,k}(\vect{u}^{\,n+1})
&=& {|\Omega_i|}^{\,(k-2)/2}
||div (\text{corrected mass flow after the pressure step})
                                              -\ \Gamma||_{{L}^{2}(\Omega_i)} \\
&=& {|\Omega_i|}^{\,(1-k)/2}
|div (\text{corrected mass flow after the pressure step})-\ \Gamma|
\end{array}
\end{equation}
Ideally, it is equal to zero when the Poisson equation related to the pressure is
solved exactly.

{\bf IEST = IESCOR\index{IESCOR}: correction}  (default name: EsCor).
The estimator $ \eta^{\,corr}_{\,i,k}(\vect{u}^{\,n+1})$ comes directly
from the mass flow calculated with the updated velocity field:
\begin{eqnarray*}
            \eta^{\,corr}_{\,i,k}(\vect{u}^{\,n+1})=
|\Omega_i|^{\,\delta_{\,2,k}}\ |div (\rho^n \vect{u}^{n+1}) -\ \Gamma|
\end{eqnarray*}
The velocities $\vect{u}^{n+1}$ are taken at the cell centers,
the divergence is calculated after projection on the faces.\\
            $ \,\delta_{\,2,k}$ represents the Kronecker symbol.\\
\hspace*{0.5cm}$\bullet$ The first family, $k=1$, is the absolute raw
value of the divergence of the mass flow minus the mass source term.\\
\hspace*{0.5cm}$\bullet$ The second family, $k=2$, represents a physical
property and allows to evaluate the difference in $kg.s^{\,-1}$.\\
Ideally, it is equal to zero when the Poisson equation is solved exactly and
the projection from the mass flux at the faces to the velocity at the cell
centers is made in a set of  functions with null divergence.

{\bf IEST = IESTOT\index{IESTOT}: total} (default name: EsTot).
The estimator $ \eta^{\,tot}_{\,i,k}(\vect{u}^{\,n+1})$, local variable
calculated at every cell $\Omega_i$, is based on the quantity
$\vect{\mathcal R}^{\,tot}(\vect{u}^{\,n+1})$, which represents the
residual of the equation using the updated values of

\subsubsection{Calculation of the distance to the wall}
%==================================

\motcle{ICDPAR}{I}{-1, 1, -2 or 2}{-1}{O}{L2}
{specifies the method used to calculate the distance to the wall $y$ and the
adimensional distance $y^+$ for all the
cells of the calculation domain (when necessary):\\
\hspace*{1.3cm}= 1: standard algorithm (based on a Poisson equation for $y$ and
convection equation for $y^+$),
with reading of the distance to the wall from the restart file
if possible\\
\hspace*{1.3cm}=-1: standard algorithm (based on a Poisson equation for $y$ and
convection equation for $y^+$),
with systematic recalculation of the distance to the wall in case of
calculation restart\\
\hspace*{1.3cm}= 2: former algorithm (based on geometrical
considerations),
with reading of the distance to the wall from the restart file
if possible\\
\hspace*{1.3cm}=-2: former algorithm (based on geometrical
considerations) with systematic recalculation of the distance to the
wall in case of calculation restart\\
In case of restart calculation, if the position of the walls haven't changed,
reading the distance to the wall from the restart file can save a fair amount of
CPU time.\\
Useful in $R_{ij}-\varepsilon$ model with wall echo (ITURB(IPHAS)=30 and IRIJEC=1),
in LES with van Driest damping (ITURB(IPHAS)=40 and IDRIES(IPHAS)=1) and
in $k-\omega$ SST (ITURB(IPHAS)=60). \\
By default, ICDPAR is initialied to -1, in case there has been a change in the
definition of the boundary conditions between two computations (change in the
number or the positions of the walls). Yet, with the $k-\omega$ SST model, the
distance to the wall is needed to calculate the turbulent viscosity, which is
done before the calculation of the distance to the wall. Hence, when this model
is used (and only in that case), ICDPAR is set to 1 by default, to ensure total
continuity of the calculation at restart.\\
{\bf As a consequence, with the \boldmath$k-\omega$\unboldmath\ SST model, if
the number and positions of the walls are changed at a calculation restart, it
is mandatory for the user to set ICDPAR explicitly to -1}, otherwise the
distance to the wall used will not correspond to the actual position of the
walls.\\
The former algorithm is not compatible with parallelism nor periodicity. Also,
whatever the value chosen for ICDPAR, the calculation of the distance to the
wall is made at the most once for all a the beginning of the calculation. It is
therefore not compatible with moving walls. Please contact the development team
if you need to override this limitation.}


The following options are related to ICDPAR=1 or -1. The options of
level 2 are described first. Some options are used only in the case of
the calculation of the adimensional distance to the wall $y^+$ (LES model with
van Driest damping). Most of these key words are simple copies of the
key words for the numerical options of the general equations, with a potentially
specific value in the case of the calculation of the distance to the wall.\\

It is however not recommended to modify those which do not belong to

{\em dp\_C3P}, {\em dp\_C3PSJ}, or {\em dp\_C4P};
pulverised coal combustion: {\em dp\_FCP}; electric module: {\em dp\_ELE})\\
IRAYPP allows to choose between the discrete ordinates method and the
P-1 method (see IRAYON) and to choose the method used to calculate the
absorption coefficient. The absorption coefficient may be set by the
user in the data file (then, \mbox{IMODAK=0}) or calculated using
``Modak\footnote{for details about the calculation of the absorption
coefficient, please refer to MODAK A.T., ``Radiation from products
of combustion''}'' (then, IMODAK=1).
The options are the followings:\\
\hspace*{1.3cm} = 1 discrete ordinates method with the absorption coefficient
given by the user in the data file (IMODAK=0)\\
\hspace*{1.3cm} = 2 discrete ordinates method using Modak for the
calculation of the absorption coefficient (IMODAK=1)\\

given by the user in the data file (IMODAK=0)\\
\hspace*{1.3cm} = 4 ``P-1'' model using Modak for the
calculation of the absorption coefficient (IMODAK=1)\\
For the electric module, IRAYPP is not set directly in the data file, but

\subsection{Electric module (Joule effect and electric arc): specificities}
%==================================

The electric module is composed of a Joule effect module
(IPPMOD(IELJOU)\index{IELJOU}) and an electric arc module
(IPPMOD(IELARC)\index{IELARC}).

The Joule effect module is designed to take into account the Joule effect
(for instance in glass furnaces) with real or complex potential in the
enthalpy equation. The Laplace forces are not taken into account in the
impluse momentum equation. Specific boundary conditions can be applied to
account for the coupled effect of transformers (offset) in glass furnaces.

The electric arc module is designed to take into account the Joule effect
(only with real potential) in the enthalpy equation. The Laplace forces
are taken into account in the impulse momentum equation.

The key words used in the global settings are quite few. They are
found in the subroutine \texttt{useli1} (see the description of this
user subroutine \S\ref{prg_useli1}).

\motcleb{IELCOR}{I}{0, 1}{0}{O}{L1}
{when IELCOR=1, the boundary conditions for the potential will be tuned at each
time step in order to reach a user-specified target dissipated power PUISIM
(Joule effect) or a user-specified target current intensity COUIMP (electric
arc)\\
the boundary condition tuning is controlled by the subroutine \texttt{uselrc}\\
alway useful}

\motcleb{COUIMP}{R}{real number $\geqslant 0$}{0}{O}{L1}
{with the electric arc module, COUIMP is the target current intensity ($A$)
for the calculations with boundary condition tuning for the potential\\
the target intensity will be reached if the boundary conditions are expressed
using the variable DPOT or if the initial boundary conditions are multiplied by
the variable COEJOU\\
useful with the electric arc module if IELCOR=1}

\motcleb{PUISIM}{R}{real number $\geqslant 0$}{0}{O}{L1}
{with the Joule effect module, PUISIM is the target dissipated power ($W$)

the variable COEJOU\\
useful with the Joule effect module if IELCOR=1}

\motcleb{DPOT}{R}{real number $\geqslant 0$}{0}{O}{L1}
{DPOT is the potential difference ($V$) which generates the current (and the Joule effect) for the
calculations with boundary conditions tuning for the potential. This value is
initialised set by the user (\texttt{useli1}). It is then automatically tuned
depending on the value of dissipated power (Joule effect module) or the
intensity of current (electric arc module).
In order for the correct power or intensity to be reached, the boundary
conditions for the potential must be expressed with DPOT (\texttt{uselcl}). The
tuning can be controlled in \texttt{uselrc}\\
useful if IELCOR=1}

\motcle{COEJOU}{R}{real number $\geqslant 0$}{1}{O}{L2}
{only with the Joule effect, COEJOU can be used if the user does not
wish to use DPOT. COEJOU is the coefficient to be applied to the initial
potential difference to reach the target dissipated power. Its value is
automatically initialised to 1 and is updated during the calculation.
In order for the correct power to be reached, the boundary
conditions for the potential must be expressed with COEJOU (\texttt{uselcl}). The
tuning can be controlled in \texttt{uselrc}\\

In the cases where gravity is predominant, taking into account the hydrostatic
pressure allows to get rid of the disturbances which may appear near the
horizontal walls when the flow is little convective.\\

Otherwise, when ICFGRP=0, the pressure condition is calculated
from the solution of the unidimensional Euler equations for a perfect

Most of these key words may be modified in the user subroutines
\texttt{uslag1}, \texttt{uslag2}, \texttt{uslabo}, \texttt{uslaen},
\texttt{uslast} and \texttt{uslaed}. It is however strongly recommended
not to modify those belonging to the level L3.

First of all, it should be noted that the Lagrangian module is compliant with
all the RANS turbulence models and with laminar flows. However, the particule
turbulent diffusion is not specially adapted to the second order
$R_{ij}-\varepsilon$ models. The same isotropic model is used as in the
$k-\varepsilon$ models, with $k$ calculated from the trace of $R_{ij}$. Also,
two-way coupling is not compatible with the $k-\omega$ SST model.

get boundary statistics. The user can choose between two average types:\\

\hspace*{1.3cm} = 1: a time-average is calculated. The cumulated value
is divided by the physical duration in the case of stationary
averages (ISTTIO=1). The cumulated value is divided by the value of
the last time step in the case of non-stationary averages (ISTTIO=0),
and also in the case of stationary averages while the
absolute Lagrangian iteration number is inferior to NSTBOR\\
\hspace*{1.3cm} = 2: a particulate average is calculated. The cumulated
value is divided by the number of particle/boundary interactions (in term of
statistical weight) recorded in PARBOR(NFABOR,INBR). This average can only
be calculated when INBRBD=1. The average is calculated if the number
of interactions (in statistical weight) of the considered boundary face
